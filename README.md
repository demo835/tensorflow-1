# tensorflow-1

#### What is it?
A Deep Learning Library

#### Why did you choose this subject?
Toward the goal of incorporating AI text generation in a class project

#### How were you first made aware of it?
Youtube Video

#### What problem does it solve?
Automatic, dynamic text generation

#### How does it solve the problem (conceptually)?
Expresses a numeric computation as a graph. Graph nodes are operations which have any number of inputs and outputs. Graph edges are tensors which flow between nodes.

#### Why does one use it?
Built-in support for deep learning, includes tools to assemble neural networks, differentiation and optimizers

#### What are the alternatives?
Theano, Keras, Torch

#### What is it similar to, if anything?
Not similiar to other technology.

#### What is the history of this technology?
Created with C/C++ backend
 
#### Who built it and why?
Google - originally created for tasks with heavy numerical computations

#### Who is maintaining it?
It's open source

#### What is your opinion on the technology after having built something with it?
You don't need to understand it to use it.

#### What are the biggest conceptual hurdles (if any) you encountered when researching this?

#### What resources do you recommend for interested students?

#### What article or forum was most helpful to you in learning this?

#### What are 3 interview questions one might be asked about this technology?

#### Also, please include the instructions necessary to:

#### Run your example.
The LSTM NN included in this project requires python, tensorflow, and Keras installed on your computer. Enter a terminal and browse to the project folder. Type main.py and press enter. The script will take a few minutes to finish one cycle (epoch). It will likely take hours or days to complete all recommended epochs.

#### Use your subject.
